Specifically, Silverman told&nbsp;People&nbsp;in 2008 that their relationship worked because they "really, really, really like each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's kind and funny and maybe the most thoughtful person I know," she added.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kimmel, meanwhile, said, "Sarah is funny and smart and good to look at.

Kimmel was hosting, and Silverman was obligated to make a joke at his expense. Her blow of choice? Describing her future boyfriend as "fat" with "no charisma," she recalled during a 2007 interview on CNBC Prime.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thus, a friendship was born. Kimmel hired Silverman for his prank call series,&nbsp;Crank Yankers, and around season 2, they "started hanging out and watching movies together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had known each other for a while, just watching movies and stuff, just being friends," Silverman told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Esquire</a>&nbsp;in 2007.&nbsp;"And then one night we were watching&nbsp;Broadway Danny Rose.&nbsp;Jimmy went in for the first kiss, and both of us — we were probably nose to nose for what seemed like forty minutes before either of us had the guts to just go ahead and kiss.
