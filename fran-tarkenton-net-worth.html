Born on 3 February 1940, Fran is one of the all-time most successful football players in America, active from 1961 until 1978.</p><p>A legendary sportsperson who has managed to set many records in his profession, one may wonder how rich is Fran as of now? As of early 2016, Fran counts his net worth at the amount of $40 million. Needless to say, Fran’s involvement in NFL as a successful footballer is one of the most important sources of his wealth. Being a television personality as well as a computer software executive has also been significant in adding to his net worth over the years.</p><h3>Fran Tarkenton Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>Raised in Richmond, and Athens, Georgia, Fran attended Athens High School and later the University of Georgia where he also played football. His professional football career started when he was selected in the 1961 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, for whom he played until 1966 before being signed by the New York Giants, playing for them until 1971. He then returned to the Minnesota Vikings, and played there until he retired as a footballer in 1978. Needless to say, all of these participations in NFL games were very significant in adding to Fran’s riches over the years.</p><p>Tarkenton played 18 seasons, with statistics, of 3,686 of 6,467 passes completed for 47,003 yards, 342 touchdowns, and 266 interceptions. His career passing yardage ranks him 8th of all time, and touchdowns is 6th in NFL history. His 124 regular season victories by a starting quarterback places him 6th on the all-time list. He also scrambled for 3,674 rushing yards (4th all-time) and 32 touchdowns in 15 different seasons, a quarterback record for the NFL. Only one other NFL quarterback has rushed for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons. On retirement, Fran had set NFL records for a career in wins by a starting quarterback, pass attempts, completions, yardage, and touchdowns, plus rushing yards by a quarterback. He obviously earned his net worth!</p><p>During his career, Fran played in the Pro Bowl nine times and was NFC champion three times in 1973, 1974 and 1976. For his contributions towards football, he was awarded with the titles AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year and UPI NFC Player of the Year in 1975. Given his impeccable skills in football, he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986 and again in College Football Hall of Fame in 1987. He is still one of the best players to have ever played in the NFL.</p><p>Apart from playing American football, Fran has made quite a name for himself as a computer software program pioneer. He also founded a software program generating company named “Tarkenton Software” which was later sold to Sterling Software in 1994 after merging with KnowledgeWare, another software company. During that time, he served as the president of the company and even toured America to promote the sales of computer-aided software engineering along with Albert F. Case of Nastec Corporation. Needless to say, Fran’s career as a computer software executive has also helped him add a lot to his riches.</p><p>As for his personal life, Fran is married to his third wife, Linda Sebastian – they have four children and live in Atlanta, Georgia. He was formerly married to Anne Merrell(1960-82). Also a published author, Fran now enjoys his days as a retired professional footballer while his present net worth of $40 million caters to his daily life.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.66338028169><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Fran Tarkenton</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 3, 1940</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Richmond, Virginia, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>190 lbs (86 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Georgia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Linda Sebastian Tarkenton</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Matthew Tarkenton, Angela Tarkenton, Hayley Tarkenton, Melissa Tarkenton</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Parents</td><td>Dallas Tarkenton, Sr., Frances Tarkenton</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Dallas Tarkenton Jr., Wendell Tarkenton</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Francis Asbury Tarkenton</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/FranTarkenton10</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0850470</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award, Bert Bell Award, AP Most Valuable Player</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>That's Incredible!</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1st & Ten: The Championship</td><td>1984-1985</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Play-by-play Announcer / Play-by-play announcer</td></tr><tr><td>Hill Street Blues</td><td>1981</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Sportscaster</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>MASH</td><td>1970</td><td></td><td>Football Player - 325th Evac.
