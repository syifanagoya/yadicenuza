Inadequate Amount of Water
If freshly planted daylilies produce yellow leaves that begin to turn brown, the issue may be due to a lack of water in the environment. During the growth season, which is normally from early spring to early autumn, the soil around daylilies should not be allowed to dry up entirely.
