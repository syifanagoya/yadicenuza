In fact, the 27-year-old singer is repping his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong> </a>thanks to his <a href=#>A+ accessory game</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Jewelry was always going to be a part of Harry’s onstage look when he planned this tour, but his relationship with Olivia has turned this costuming idea into a genuine shared passion,” a source exclusively shared with Us Weekly.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 37-year-old actress actually gifts the singer baubles to wear while he’s performing. “He’s wearing pieces on stage that she only gave him recently and he’s traveling with a trunk load of the stuff. He just isn’t shy about how much he loves that old rock and roll, jewelry-encrusted look,” the insider added.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In addition to jewelry, the “Watermelon Sugar” singer has been sending fans crazy with his on-stage outfits, which consist of fringe vests, wide-leg trousers and blouses designed largely by Gucci.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But it was Wilde who prompted a viral TikTok earlier this month, after an eagle-eyed fan picked up on the fact that the Don’t Worry Darling actress wore a piece of jewelry from her beau’s collection to the Gucci Love Parade in Los Angeles.</p><p class=p1>The Booksmart director, who sat front-row at the fashion show, paired her lace bralette, bustier and pencil skirt with a gold cross pendant on a dainty chain. The latter appears to be the same piece — or a very similar one — to a necklace Styles has been spotted wearing on multiple occasions.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Wilde doesn’t just wear Styles’ jewelry though. She’s also <a href=#>a fan of his merch</a>. In October, the star stepped out in a “Treat People With Kindness” hoodie from the singer’s line. The week prior, she also carried his Love On Tour tote bag while out and about in Los Angeles.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The pair’s romance first made headlines in January, when they were spotted holding hands at Styles’ manger’s wedding, just two months after she split from former fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>At the time, a source exclusively told Us that the two formed a connection while on set of Don’t Worry Darling. “Harry and Olivia had chemistry almost instantaneously on set,” the insider said. “It was only a matter of time before they got together.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52us77YZqqtsZyawG60wKxkm52Vo3q4scCroKefXZy2p8DSZp2rp51ivK211aKYZq%2BZobGmec6nZKyskZyycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./milk-sugar-crossword-clue-nyt-7-letters-1183485.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Milk sugar Crossword Clue NYT 7 letters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./park-overall-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Park Overall Net Worth 2024: Salary, Income and Investment Insights</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-perry-net-worth.html>Anne Perry Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-franke-wiki.html>Kevin Franke (Ruby Franke Husband) Age: Biography, Wife, Children, Wiki, Latest News, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./edgerrin-james-net-worth.html>Edgerrin James Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faker-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Faker Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-fich-net-worth.html>Charlotte Fich Net Worth 2024: Assets, Income Sources And More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
