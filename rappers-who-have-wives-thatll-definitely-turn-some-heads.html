The West African model, who moved to America from Gabon and spoke very little English at the time, has since founded her own charity, Unspoken Angels, that helps survivors of abuse.</p><p dir=ltr>"There are few things of more importance to me than to reach back to young ladies who have experienced abuses and be able to help them deal with the hurt, betrayal, and feelings of inadequacy that I too have suffered in association with those abuses," Mbouguiengue explained in a statement on the organization's website. She also called the non-profit "a vehicle to let young ladies know they are not alone and there is life after abuse."</p><p dir=ltr>And philanthropy is an interest that the celebrity couple share. On her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Mbouguiengue revealed that they had first met during one of the rapper's Ludaday events, which Ludacris started to bring celebrities and families together for a good cause. "Wow! Today marks 10 years we've known each other," she wrote. "We met August 30, Ludaday weekend 2008, but don't get it twisted he didn't get to kiss these lips until 2009."</p><p dir=ltr>They were married in 2014, as Ludacris told <a href=#>Distractify</a>. "It has been amazing," the rapper declared. "I think that our love for giving back and our love for charity and our love for a growing family and continuing to raise strong children is what's so strong about the unit."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pgZoN5e9Gap6mdoqh6uLTOZp%2BarpVixKrCxKxkraCRqbmtecOenaKmmamyrcWMrayrpl2ovK6xjKGcmpyjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./latto.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Latto- Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marilyn-monroe-may-have-filled-diary-with-jfk-secrets-after-affair.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marilyn Monroe May Have Filled Diary With JFK Secrets After Affair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-perry-net-worth.html>Anne Perry Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-franke-wiki.html>Kevin Franke (Ruby Franke Husband) Age: Biography, Wife, Children, Wiki, Latest News, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./edgerrin-james-net-worth.html>Edgerrin James Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faker-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Faker Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-fich-net-worth.html>Charlotte Fich Net Worth 2024: Assets, Income Sources And More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
