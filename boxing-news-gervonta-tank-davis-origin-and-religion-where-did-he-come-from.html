In an active resume of 25-0, Davis has 24 stoppages under his belt and is undoubtedly one of the finest in the world right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has already been a PPV star, honed by the great Floyd Mayweather. Having shown similarities with Mayweather, there’s a lot awaiting the youngster ahead.</p><p>Coming from a tough childhood, Davis is now a millionaire. Here’s a look at Gervonta Davis’ heritage and history.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-20-year-old-student-collapses-and-dies-due-to-a-charity-boxing-match?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/10065b52-f312-43ae-a3b8-0453b4ef20af-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">20-Year-Old Student Collapses and Dies Due to a Charity Boxing Match</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Is Gervonta Davis Hispanic?</h2><p>A lot of people thought Davis to be Hispanic or Mexican after he donned the Mexican national colors in his walk-out for the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Leo Santa Cruz</a> fight. However, it was just a follow-up to what his mentor <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Floyd Mayweather</a> did against <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Oscar De La Hoya</a> back in 2007. Several casuals assumed Davis to be a Mexican after that.</p><p>However, ‘Tank’ is a proud American and has been one of the most entertaining pugilists to come from the country. While he is already a renowned superstar in the USA, Davis is rapidly becoming a global phenomenon.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Gervonta Davis’ hometown: Where did he originate from? Is he an American citizen?</h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>‘Tank’</a> was born on November 7, 1994, in <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Baltimore</a>, Maryland USA. He still represents the same city and is clearly an American citizen. Coming from a middle-class family, Davis dropped down from education to pursue his career in boxing.</p><p>And it fetched him the right results. Aged 18, he became a pro-boxer and is now a world champion. Thus, it has been all glory for the youngster so far.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What is Gervonta Davis’ ethnicity? Does Gervonta Davis follow a religion?</h2><p>According to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reports</a>, Gervonta Davis comes from a mixed ethnicity. Many <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reports</a> claim him to be an African-American, but Davis has never spoken openly about it. He is a Christian by birth. Nicknamed ‘Tank’, Davis is now looking to explore the lightweight division more. And he is already in the top-tier conversation.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Top 5 Best Selling PPV Fights of Floyd Mayweather’s Boxing Career</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZp6eqqaku7WtjK2Yp6Ndma63tdJmpquhl567bq3NnWSrnZyetKq7zWauoZ2imnqltcNmn55lk6S6pnnFq6amZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-tambor-wife-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Tambor: Wife, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uma-thurman-cannes-nice-airport.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uma Thurman and baby Luna jet out of Cannes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-perry-net-worth.html>Anne Perry Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-franke-wiki.html>Kevin Franke (Ruby Franke Husband) Age: Biography, Wife, Children, Wiki, Latest News, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./edgerrin-james-net-worth.html>Edgerrin James Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faker-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Faker Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-fich-net-worth.html>Charlotte Fich Net Worth 2024: Assets, Income Sources And More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
