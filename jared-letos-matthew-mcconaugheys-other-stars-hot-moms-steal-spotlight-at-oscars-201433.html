Take a look at the hot moms who attended this year’s Academy Awards in the roundup below.</p><p>Leto brought his gorgeous mother Constance, in a beautiful gown with a black-lace overlay, as his date. The mother and son posed together on the red carpet, showing off their striking resemblance</p><p>While accepting the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Dallas Buyers Club, Leto, 42, gave a touching thank-you to his mom. “In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl who was pregnant with her second child. She was a high school dropout and a single mom, but somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children. She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special. That girl is my mother and she’s here tonight,” he said onstage. “And I just want to say, I love you, Mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Leto’s costar, McConaughey, walked the red carpet with his mom, Kay, and wife<strong> Camila Alves</strong>. The proud mother showed off her amazing figure — and toned legs — in a short silver dress. During a red carpet interview with ABC, Kay said: “Let me tell you, he deserves it. Yes, indeed. He’s earned it. I’m very proud of him.</p><p>Apparently, mother really does know best as McConaughey took home the Best Actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club. “To my mother who’s here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers . . . demanded that we respect ourselves,” McConaughey, 44, said onstage in his acceptance speech. “And what we in turn learned was that we were then better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>McConaughey’s Wolf of Wall Street costar and fellow Best Actor nominee, <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>, brought his mom, Irmelin Indenbirken, as his date on Sunday — much to the disappointment of leggy models around the world. The 39-year-old actor posed for photos with his mother, who wore a short gold gown, on the red carpet and sat with her in the audience during the show.</p><p>DiCaprio has previously credited Irmelin for his success in Hollywood. “She supported this little kid who said, ‘I want to be an actor,’ at 12 years old, which is ridiculous, and she drove me to all these auditions,” he told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> back in January. “She’s the only reason I’m able to do what I do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#><strong>Jonah Hill</strong></a>, who starred alongside DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street and earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination, took his proud mom, Sharon Lyn, as his Oscars date. Flashing a big smile to photographers, Sharon looked stunning in a strapless navy gown while posing beside her son. “She’s flirting with<strong> <a href=#>Bradley</a></strong><a href=#> [</a><strong>Cooper</strong><a href=#>]</a>, <strong>Channing</strong> [<strong>Tatum</strong>], and everybody. It’s kind of a disaster!” Hill, 30, joked about his mom to ABC on the carpet. “He’s so cute!” Sharon quipped.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, this list really wouldn’t be complete without including <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>‘s famous mother, <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>. The 68-year-old veteran actress walked the red carpet with longtime love <strong>Kurt Russell</strong>, and looked ageless and radiant while presenting onstage. Hawn wore a gold, off-the-shoulder Versace gown that showed of her stunning figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Which star’s hot mom deserves the award for Best Dressed?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGaqpWZeq2x06iqZqWRqcGpsdZmpJybn6OutrPHnrCsZZ%2Bptaa%2BjKyrmqqjYrWwwIympqarXajBpq3LZqqpp6Shtqi002aYrWWfqLCivtJmaWlpZGiA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-what-rory-mcilroy-and-tiger-woods-got-for-staying-loyal-to-the-pga.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What Rory McIlroy And Tiger Woods Got For Staying Loyal To The PGA</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jalen-hill-ucla-parents-mom-high-school-obituary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jalen Hill UCLA Parents, Mom, High School, Obituary</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-perry-net-worth.html>Anne Perry Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-franke-wiki.html>Kevin Franke (Ruby Franke Husband) Age: Biography, Wife, Children, Wiki, Latest News, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./edgerrin-james-net-worth.html>Edgerrin James Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faker-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Faker Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-fich-net-worth.html>Charlotte Fich Net Worth 2024: Assets, Income Sources And More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
