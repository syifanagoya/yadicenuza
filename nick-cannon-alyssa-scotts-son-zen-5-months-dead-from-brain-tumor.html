The former Nickelodeon star held his son for the last time during a trip to see the ocean in California on Sunday, December 5.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nick-Cannon-Reveals-His-Alyssa-Scott-Son-Zen-Died-From-Brain-Tumor-Tearful-Announcement-0003.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Masked Singer </a>host noted that his and the 28-year-old model’s son went to the doctor for what was believed to be a sinus issue when he was 2 months old. Fluid was building up in his head, and the infant’s brain tumor required immediate surgery.</p><p>The Wild ’N Out stars <a href=#>welcomed their newborn in June</a>. Zen was Cannon’s seventh child as he also shares twins Morocco and Monroe, 10, with <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>, son Golden, 4, and daughter Powerful, 11 months, with <strong>Brittany Bell</strong>, and twins Zillion and Zion, 5 months, with <strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nick-Cannon-Reveals-His-Alyssa-Scott-Son-Zen-Died-From-Brain-Tumor-Tearful-Announcement-0002.jpg><p>Scott has not addressed Zen’s death but did post Instagram Story videos of the little one on Tuesday. “Can you say, ‘Good morning, Daddy?'” she asked her baby boy in touching footage as he cooed. “Say, ‘Bye-bye, Daddy.’ Wave bye-bye.”</p><p>The Texas native, who also has a daughter from a previous relationship, has been “amazing” during the tragedy, Cannon gushed on Tuesday.</p><p>“[She’s] the strongest woman I’ve ever seen,” the California native said on his show. “We never had an argument. She was emotional when she needed to be but always was the best mom and continues to be the best mom.”</p><p>He reflected his late child’s personality, saying, “He was the most loving. We called him Z Chilling. He was always smiling. He had the most beautiful spirit.” Cannon subsequently dedicated the episode to Zen.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last month, the All That alum told <a href=#><strong>Dr. Mehmet Oz</strong></a> that he was on the fence about <a href=#>expanding his family further</a>.</p><p>“I don’t know how I’ll feel in five years,” Cannon said during the November interview. “When people say, ‘Are you going to have more kids?’ that’s a difficult question to ask unless I did have something like a vasectomy. Because I don’t know if I’m going to find love again. I don’t know how deep I’ll go again. I don’t know. You never understand what the universe is going to present to you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2WRoca0v8BmqpynpKnAbr%2FOp2SznZ5igm65zqeroatdmbKisIyfqailXZe%2ForXNZquupZ%2BnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christoph-eschenbach-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Christoph Eschenbach 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anastasia-ashley-net-worth-270688.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anastasia Ashley Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anne-perry-net-worth.html>Anne Perry Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kevin-franke-wiki.html>Kevin Franke (Ruby Franke Husband) Age: Biography, Wife, Children, Wiki, Latest News, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./edgerrin-james-net-worth.html>Edgerrin James Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./faker-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Faker Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-fich-net-worth.html>Charlotte Fich Net Worth 2024: Assets, Income Sources And More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
