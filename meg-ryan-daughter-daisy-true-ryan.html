The adoption process was kept private, and Meg announced the arrival of her new daughter through her representative.&nbsp;</p><p>Meg was overwhelmed with emotion on the day she brought Daisy True home. “I never laughed harder or cried more…I was so nervous about the whole thing,” she said of the adoption process.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meg Ryan and her adopted child, Daisy True Ryan</h2><p>Since adopting Daisy True, Meg has been incredibly private about her daughter’s life.

She gave birth to her daughter, fell in love, and got married to her current husband, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cole DeBoer</a> —&nbsp; all in front of the public’s eyes.</p><p>All in all, people have seen Chelsea since she was a child and have seen her transformation to date. Comparing her before and after photos, netizens have noticed various changes in Chelsea.</p><p>From her getting a lot of tattoos to going through a massive weight loss transformation, Chelsea has transformed. However, many could not help but notice some subtle changes in the reality TV star, which could be possible only through plastic surgery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chelsea DeBoer’s plastic surgery and tattoos</h2><p>Since Chelsea has left Teen Mom 2, netizens have been speculating that she underwent plastic surgery. They mostly comment on her Instagram and TikTok posts about how she looks unrecognizable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Plastic surgeon Dr. Richard Westreich also agreed that Chelsea had gone under the knife and gave his speculation to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The U.S Sun</a>. He noted that she looked different than before because of the work she had done on her lips and chin.</p><p>He said, “The main cosmetic work she has done is her lips and chin. I think there has been some lip filler and manipulation of the chin using filler as well.” He claimed that she did not get a chin implant but used fillers to get rid of the chin cleft she had.</p><p>“Chelsea previously had a cleft in her chin, like a dimple in the middle. But from around March 2022, it’s gone. I don’t see any real clefting of her chin.

All in all, the plastic surgeon believed that her weight loss might have triggered her need to go under the knife.</p><p>He pointed out, “Her main changes are the weight loss, the hair, filler in the chin, and filler in the lips. She had a lot of weight loss, so it is also possible that she needed some body work.”</p><p>While taking all that into consideration, it should also be stressed that Chelsea has not explicitly admitted to getting plastic surgery. However, she has been open about getting lip fillers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In November 2022, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on Instagram that she was undergoing lip fillers.

Warms up my little heart?”</p><p>“Getting my lips plumped up for the holidays.” “It’s just a touch-up, so just like a little bit, right, cuz I don’t wanna go crazy,” Chelsea explained of the amount of filler she was having injected before pouting for the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>In the videos, she also admitted to getting Botox touch-ups. Chelsea hinted in 2016 that she had Botox from her father, who was also a dentist.</p><p>Although Botox is frequently used by dentists to relax the stiff muscles that lead to TMJ, she posted an Instagram photo of her father caressing her forehead while people around them shined mobile phone flashlights on them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Chelsea captioned the image “Botox party” to confirm what was going on. However, she has never confessed to getting chin fillers.</p><p>Chelsea might have had a massive transformation via plastic surgery and weight loss, but tattoos have also aided her transformation. In the past few years, she has gotten a lot of tattoos.</p><p>She has inked flowers on her arms. On her hands, she has made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tattoos</a> of hearts, stars, arrows, and the word ‘gratitude.’ While many have bashed her for her tattoos, it has not stopped Chelsea from getting more body art.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Chelsea DeBoer?</h2><p>Chelsea became known to the public in 2011 after participating in MTV’s Teen Mom 2.
